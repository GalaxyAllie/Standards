This standard will apply to Magical Girl Standards MG0001 to MG9999, inclusive.

## Terminology

**Magical Girl Standards** means any standard hosted on this website.

## Global Rules

All Magical Girl Standards must have the following sections:

### Introduction

Provide a broad overview of the problem domain, leading into the need for the standard.

### scope

Define in what contexts the standard should apply. This might require clarification of partial applications, exemptions and other edge cases.

### Terminology

Define any specialist terms used within the problem domain or the standard itself. This section need not be included if no terms need to be defined.

### Global Rules

Define the rules of the standard itself.
