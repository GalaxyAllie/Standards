# Magical Girl Standards

The Magical Girl Standards website aims to reduce confusion and miscommunication by defining appropriate behaviour online and off.

By codifying existing behaviour within a non-restrictive framework the Standards promote accessibility without coming at the cost of stifling innovation. In other words: here are some ways people do things, but feel free to do things your own way.

## Installation

1. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Verify Jekyll is installed with `jekyll -v`
3. Install the Jekyll sitemap plugin using `gem install jekyll-sitemap`

## Usage

Run `jekyll serve` then navigate to http://localhost:4000/
